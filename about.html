<p>A brief history: I graduated from FSU with a degree in English Literature, took a couple years off to write a novel, rescued a dog, got married, moved to 3 different states in 3 years, and eventually realized I love coding and want to be a developer! Phew! And that brings me to now: I'm a student at Flatiron who knows a little, but not a lot and wants to change that :)</p>
