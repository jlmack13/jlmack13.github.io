My journey to coding began about 4 years ago. I was (relatively) fresh out of college, having graduated with a degree in Literature from FSU. It started with WordPress. I was playing around with building WordPress sites and often found myself frustrated by the limits of the themes I was working with. I began tinkering with HTML and CSS in order to make small changes and wrangle the themes to my liking. It was exciting to see my changes take effect, to see immeditate visual changes and know that I had created them. That was the beginning of my love of coding. Free resources like Codecademy helped me get started and soon I joined Treehouse so I could learn more about coding and web design. I also found great resources like Skillcrush and I enrolled in their WordPress Developer Blueprint, which was fantasic but I still wanted to learn more.

Eventually, I enrolled in school again to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I spent three semesters working towards my second degree before I could no longer ignore that my priorities and the school's didn't match up. I had always been interested in learning web development and there simply wasn't the curriculum to support that at the school. 

But now I had a problem, I knew the basics (and maybe a little more) but I still needed to continue my education if I was going to be successful in my chosen field. Enter coding bootcamps, the solution to my problem. After a lot of research and debate I chose Flatiron's Online Web Developer Program and here I am. 

It was sort of a roundabout journey to get here. I didn't even consider coding as an interest, let alone a career path, until I was well into my twenties. Regardless of how I got here and however long it took to arrive, I'm thrilled to have found this passion and I look forward to seeing where the journey takes me.
