This is attempt #2 to write this blog post as the learn blog editor and my computer conspired to torture me (I accidentally hit the back gesture on my laptop and lost everything). 

I supposed that’s what I get for rushing and not typing this into an word processor like a proper writer. 

Here we go again…

This post is about my final project for the bootcamp. My final project! I almost can’t believe it. It has been quite the journey, one I am so happy I went on. I’ve learned so much during the process and I feel so proud of all the projects that have lead me here. 

For this project, the requirements were fairly open. We could create any app of our choice as long as:

1. We used React and Redux with a Rails API backend. 
2. We have 3 routes, using react-router and proper RESTful routing.
3. We have at least 2 container components and at least 5 stateless components. 

Of course, there’s a bit more to it, but that’s about the gist of the requirements this time around. 

For my project, I decided to create an app that keeps track of all the legendary loot in the video game, Borderlands 2. To make it even easier for players who are looking to do a loot run play through of the story, I created a story mode page in my app that displays all the loot you can farm in a single play through in the best order to tackle the challenge.  

To build my app, I broke it down into several smaller steps to make it more manageable:

1. Built a simple stateless React app with the basic components of my app in place. 
2. Built a stateful version of my app with dummy information. At this point, my app was pretty barebones. 
3. Built my Rails API backend. 
4. Connected the Rails backend to my React front end and tested it out to make sure it was all working correctly. 
5. Added in the rest of the features and components I knew I wanted in my app, which I had left out earlier for simplicity’s sake. 
6. Added routes using react-router. 
7. Added extra features that used state, for example I wanted to have a button to show/hide my form. 
8. Blew everything up by adding Redux! 
9. Slowly rebuilt everything with Redux this time, until all the requirements were met. 
10. Styled, styled, styled! I waited until the very end to do the heavy lifting with my CSS. I have a strong tendency to spend a lot of time on styling and experimenting with different designs. To ensure I was focusing on the functionality of my app before the form I planned this final touches styling out from the start of my project. 

Which brings me to now, writing this post so I can submit my project…for the last time. Just one more assessment and another blog post before graduation! I can’t wait!
